This is an example repository for working with rails and postgres, and setting them up using docker-compose.

To run this app, do the following. 

1. Install docker
1. Run `docker-compose up`
2. This would run the web service in a container and postgres in a container. 
3. Would look something like this.

4. This would take a while the first time. 
5. Now we need to create db before we can go any further. For this we'll connect to the docker container. 
	6. In another terminal run `docker ps`
	7. ![alt text](blog_images/docker_ps.png)
	8. Copy the container id for web, and connect to container by running this command. `docker exec -it 1597728759c0 sh`
	9. You'll be connected to the docker container. 
	10. Run `rake db:create && rake db:migrate`
6. Go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and see if everything is working. 
7. Run all your rails commands in the container itself. 
8. Try running `rails g scaffold blog title:string body:string`
9. Go to [http://localhost:3000/blogs](http://localhost:3000/blogs) and see if everything works. 
10.
